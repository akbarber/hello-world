It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
### This is an <h3> tag
#### This is an <h4> tag
##### This is an <h5> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag



*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_


**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__


_You **can** combine them_





* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
  
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
